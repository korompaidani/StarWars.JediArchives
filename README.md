# StarWars.JediArchives
This is the Backend of my Star Wars universe. It will feed any client of my related ecosystem.
This is for practicing clean architecture design purposes.
Star Wars and Jedi are trademarked expressions.
Creating a product from this code is NOT intended I just love to use Star Wars related names when practicing or learning something.
It has been made comfortable and fun.
